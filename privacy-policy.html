        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: May 2025</p>

        <p>CiteCraft respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains in detail what data we access, how we use it, and how we safeguard your information when you use our Google Docs add-on.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
        <p>We only access the data necessary to provide the core functionality of CiteCraft. This includes your Google account email and basic profile information, which we use solely for authentication purposes to verify your identity and ensure authorized use of the add-on.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we access the content of the active Google Docs document you are editing to insert citations automatically at your request. This access is strictly limited to the active document and does not extend to any other files in your Google Drive.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>The data we access is used exclusively to perform the citation generation and insertion services. We do not use your data for any other purpose beyond providing these core functionalities.</p>
        <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose any personal data or document content to third parties. All processing of your document content happens within your Google Workspace environment without transmission to our servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>CiteCraft does not retain any content from your Google Docs documents after the citation insertion process is complete. All data processing is temporary and occurs only during your active session with the add-on.</p>
        <p>Your authentication information, such as your email and profile data, is also not stored beyond the session and is used strictly for verification purposes during your interaction with CiteCraft.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures consistent with industry standards to protect any data accessed during your session. However, since CiteCraft operates entirely within the Google Workspace environment, the security of your document content is primarily governed by Google's policies and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Our access is strictly limited to what you permit and is restricted to the scope necessary for the add-on’s functionality.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You retain full control over the data access permissions granted to CiteCraft. You may revoke the add-on’s access at any time through your Google Account’s security settings. Once revoked, CiteCraft will no longer have access to your documents or account information until access is granted again.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to review and manage your app permissions regularly to ensure your data privacy and security.</p>

        <h2>6. Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>CiteCraft does not use cookies to collect personal data. However, Google and your browser may use cookies for authentication and security purposes to maintain a safe and smooth user experience.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page, and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@citecraftnow.com">support@citecraftnow.com</a>. We are committed to addressing your inquiries promptly and transparently.</p>
